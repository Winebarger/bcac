Site Map was developed by using Avenza Maps smart phone application to collect GPS data in the field which was then processed in ArcGIS 10.7. 
Base Map was developed using the LiDAR point cloud of Kentucky which was used to develop the digital elevation model and hillshade. The aerial imagery was used as a back-drop and the camp property outline was created by Beth Ann Winebarger.
Ecological Site Analysis was written by Beth Ann Winebarger (2019) based on resources from the Kentucky Geological Survey, Web Soil Survey, and United States Geological Survey.
