## Site Map
This site map of the property was developed in 2019 by using an iPhone application called Avenza Maps. Features across the property were recorded using GPS location and photographs. The map was then developed and is avaliable here for download (as a PDF or JPG) for any new or old visitors to the camp property.

## Ecological Site Analysis
The ecology of a site is integral to how that land should be managed and used by its inhabitants. Since Girl Scouts always leave a place better than how they found it, it is important for Girl Scouts of Kentucky to be mindful of the ecology of this beautiful property. This [ecological site analysis](site_analysis.md) was updated in 2019 using resources from the Kentucky Geological Survey and Web Soil Survey. (_by Beth Ann Winebarger_)




## Sources and Tools
* Point cloud and derived elevation data from KY From Above (2018)
* Aerial imagery from KY NAIP 2018, with 2ft accuracy
* GPS Data collected by Beth Ann Winebarger (2019)
* Images taken by Beth Ann Winebarger (2017)

Site Map was developed by using Avenza Maps smart phone application to collect GPS data in the field which was then processed in ArcGIS 10.7. 
Base Map was developed using the LiDAR point cloud of Kentucky which was used to develop the digital elevation model and hillshade. The aerial imagery was used as a back-drop and the camp property outline was created by Beth Ann Winebarger.
Ecological Site Analysis was written by Beth Ann Winebarger (2019) based on resources from the Kentucky Geological Survey, Web Soil Survey, and United States Geological Survey.
